Refer "Code.r" for detailed interpretation of the results.

The customers of the business were divided into three segments. Most customer belonged to the segment that did not buy high quantities or product of a high price, neither did they return products often.
The second most dominant segment was where customers bought in high quantities at low prices with an average return rate.
The last segment was only 4.3% of the customers and they bought at a high price but at lower quantites. They were also returning the products most often.

Considering how the business positions itself, these results are mixed. If the business is for premium offerings, we would have liked more customers to buy at higher prices. Most of the customers are buying cheap and at lower quantities. If the business is such that it positions itself as a budget shopping location, it ideally wants 
more customers to buy at higher quantites inspite of lower prices. Hence the ideal segment for this business only consist of 20.7% of its customers.

However Focusing on the RFM Analysis, we can see that the top 5 groups are of the poorest frequency and monetary score. Meaning they don't buy often nor do they make big purchases. This proves that the business consisting of mostly the wrong segment of customers is resulting in poor purchase repeats and monetary inflow.
